Saxion Intake Project for 2020/2021

It is a simple game level called Cerberus' Adventure. The main theme was monsters.

You play as a cerberus - monster from Greek mythology. Your main job is to collect soul lost somewhere in the underworld. But be careful, crazy unicorns, so loved by humans, want to stop you and get the soul back to the living land.

Controls:
A - move right
D - move left
Space - jump
Mouse RB - shoot
1 - pick the first head: able to shoot
2 - pick the second head: able to jump higher
3 - pick the third head: able to run faster and jump further

Everything was made by me. 

The theme is shown by the main character - a monster, but also by my graphics. I am not a graphic designer so they are little monsters.
